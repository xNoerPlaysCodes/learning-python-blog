# Learning Python Blog
My journey of learning python from scratch. (Started in 2015, ACTUALLY started in 2023 July)

Report 1, 31 July 2023.
I started the day, I coded some things for bot, I learned the define function and the while True loop function from chat gpt and youtube video, respectively.
I started the day by creating xNoerPlaysCodes/mbgtk-python , And then I fell asleep.

Report 2, 2nd August 2023.
I started the day, I coded a help command, a hello command, and ping command from ChatGPT, rest from scratch.
I tried to continue this pace but I hadn't learned enough.
